# WP-Plugin--IP-Address-Bassed-Product-Hide-and-Show
This plugin ensures you see only relevant products based on your location. When you visit the website, your IP address is used to determine your approximate location. This location data is then used to filter the displayed products. The administrator can define which products are available or recommended for specific locations. This allows for fine-grained control over product visibility based on geographic criteria.
